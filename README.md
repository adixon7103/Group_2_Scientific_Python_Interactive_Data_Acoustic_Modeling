# Group_2_Scientific_Python_Interactive_Data_Acoustic_Modeling
This is the repository for group 2 of COP2080 to maintain the Project in.


This project is written in python. It creates graphs from accepted wav/mp3 sound files.

The operating system used is Windows 11/10.

### We suggest creating a virutal environment and loading the zip file with python files:
-model.py
-main.py
-controller.py
-view.py
-tempCodeRunnerFile.py

We also suggest to download the packages in the requirements.txt file.

We used ffmpeg in this code so download that seperately.

## To start
open the main.py and run it.
You can upload a wav/mp3 file to the load audio button. You can use our 2 samples if needed to test out.
